Muscle Cell Integration
***********************

A major portion of the OpenWorm project is integrating muscle cells into the simulation. To accomplish this, our simlation must be as accurate as possible, bringing together biological data and an efficient implementation method. This is the goal of the Muscle Cell Integration team.

There is a video available that covers all the information that will be discussed on this page, but as the video is fairly long, some may find it easier to read the material. `The video can be found here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AhKE2Vg_Uw>`_.

There are some documents that are discussed in the video and will be brought up in this page as well. They are listed below:

* `Boyle and Cohen paper <http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/netta/CV/papers/BC08b.pdf>`_
* `Video agenda and update document. (Google docs) <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BByFfABx91Ao-qKFYXAP0wQONlhdDy7MtSu8G0QxUes/edit#>`_
* `Team progress report <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/openworm-discuss/muscle$20neuron/openworm-discuss/2wAHWSBJhMc/GE7V01pyQS4J>`_
